# Stability

Stability will be tested soon.

# Issues

My only jailbroken device that was on iOS 15 is currently in a broken state. Until I can find a reliable fix to this, this project will be halted. My other jailbroken device is only iOS 12.

I can't even open TrollStore or Dopamine to try and fix this. Therefore I cant test InstanceX. And, theres a lot more issues that I won't cover.

If I cant recover this device, this project will be archived and anyone can feel free to build off of the current code and fix some of the current issues with it.

# Building

I am not done creating this tweak.
